This repository features a Tableau dashboard that analyzes sales trends across various locations. The data was cleaned and pre-processed using Python prior to visualization.

An interactive dashboard was developed to examine four years of product data from the US market, focusing on year-over-year comparisons of revenue, sales, and quantities. It also ranks products and subcategories based on performance, utilizing color gradations to indicate revenue and sales. This dashboard facilitated data-driven decisions aimed at enhancing performance.
